## Summary
In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), a **latent class model** (**LCM**) is a model for clustering multivariate discrete data. It assumes that the data arise from a mixture of discrete distributions, within each of which the variables are independent. It is called a latent class model because the class to which each data point belongs is unobserved, or latent.

**Latent class analysis** (**LCA**) is a subset of [structural equation modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling "Structural equation modeling"), used to find groups or subtypes of cases in multivariate [categorical data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable "Categorical variable"). These subtypes are called "latent classes".
