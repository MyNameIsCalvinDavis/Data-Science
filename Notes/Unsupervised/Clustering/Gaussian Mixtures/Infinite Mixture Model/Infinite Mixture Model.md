## AKA
Multivariate Gaussian Mixture Model
Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model

## Summary
An IMM is typically used to fit a vector of unknown parameters, as opposed to a [[Finite Mixture Model (FMM)]] with a set number of components.

Typically uses a [[Dirichlet Process Model (DPM, DPMM)]] as a prior for the mixture to evaluate the components of a dataset.
