## AKA
Gaussian Mixture Models
## Summary
It assumes that the observed data arises from a finite number of underlying distributions, with each data point having a certain probability of belonging to each distribution

Populations are often divided into groups or subpopulations—age groups, income brackets, levels of education. Regression models or distributions likely differ across these groups. But sometimes we don't have a variable that identifies the groups. Perhaps the identifying variable is simply missing. Perhaps it is hard to collect—honest reporting of drug use, sex of goldfish, etc. Perhaps it is inherently unobservable—penchant for risky behavior, high propensity to save money, etc. In such cases, we can use finite mixture models (FMMs) to model the probability of belonging to each unobserved group, to estimate distinct parameters of a regression model or distribution in each group, to classify individuals into the groups, and to draw inferences about how each group behaves.
