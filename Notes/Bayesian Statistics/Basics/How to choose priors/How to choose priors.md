Some people like the idea of using non-informative priors (also known as flat, vague, or
diffuse priors). These priors have the least possible amount of impact on the analysis. While
it is possible to use them for some problems deriving truly non-informative priors can be
hard or just impossible. Additionally, we generally can do better as we usually have some
prior information.
