Let’s say we are surveying to see how people feel about the weather in their area. We
asked three individuals whether they enjoy sunny weather, with possible responses being “yes” or “no.” The sample space of all possible outcomes can be denoted by 𝑆 and consists of eight possible combinations:

𝑆 = {(yes, yes, yes), (yes, yes, no), (yes, no, yes), (no, yes, yes), (yes, no, no), (no, yes, no), (no, no, yes), (no, no, no)}

We can define event 𝐵 as when at least one person answered “no,” and then we
will have:

𝐵 = {(yes, yes, no), (yes, no, yes), (no, yes, yes), (yes, no, no), (no, yes, no), (no, no, yes), (no, no, no)}

We can use probabilities as a measure of how likely these events are. Assuming all events are equally likely, the probability of event 𝐴, which is the event that all three individuals answered “yes,” is:
