1. Given some data and assumptions about how the data was generated, we design a model by combining building blocks known as **probability distributions**. Most of the time they are crude approximations, which is fine.
2. Use Bayes' Theorem to add data to the model, and derive the consequence of combining the data with our assumptions. We call this **conditioning**
3. Evaluate the model under various predictions and metrics
