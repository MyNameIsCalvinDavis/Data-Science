## Summary
Variables that can only be inferred indirectly through a mathematical model from other observable variables that can be directly observed or measured.

In this situation, the term _hidden variables_ is commonly used, reflecting the fact that the variables are meaningful, but not observable. Other latent variables correspond to abstract concepts, like categories, behavioral or mental states, or data structures. The terms _hypothetical variables_ or _hypothetical constructs_ may be used in these situations.

The use of latent variables can serve to [reduce the dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction "Dimensionality reduction") of data. Many observable variables can be aggregated in a model to represent an underlying concept, making it easier to understand the data. In this sense, they serve a function similar to that of scientific theories. At the same time, latent variables link observable "[sub-symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-symbolic "Sub-symbolic")" data in the real world to symbolic data in the modeled world.
