The French Fiscal AI Innovation and Prediction Challenge, held in collaboration with the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the Science Hub of the European Union Commission, presents a unique opportunity to examine 40 years of French tax data. The JRC, known for its commitment to providing rigorous, evidence-based scientific and technical support to EU policymakers, is partnering to enhance data-driven decision-making. Participants will employ their analytical prowess and predictive modeling skills to reveal significant insights into the fiscal behaviors of French municipalities.

The challenge invites an in-depth exploration of the data, beginning with ranking municipalities by their tax revenue to identify those with the highest income from direct local taxes. Participants will create graphical representations to illustrate revenue trends in selected towns, drawing meaningful conclusions from these visualizations. The analysis extends to classifying municipalities based on their growth in tax revenues over various periods, investigating the relationship between population size and tax revenue, and assessing the impact of eliminating the professional tax collected before 2010. This comprehensive approach aims to uncover significant insights into the fiscal dynamics of French municipalities.

The dataset for this challenge is meticulously prepared to ensure efficient analysis. It is an aggregation of French REI (Répertoire des Élus et des Institutions) data files to create a comprehensive data pipeline. REI is a directory of elected officials and institutions in France, providing detailed information on French municipalities' financial and administrative aspects. Originally a 3.6GB CSV file, this dataset has been converted into a 0.6GB Parquet file. Parquet's columnar storage format allows faster data access, reduced file size, and improved query performance. This makes it particularly suitable for handling complex queries and large datasets, providing participants with a powerful tool for their analysis.

To facilitate the querying process, we highly recommend using DuckDB for interacting with the dataset. DuckDB is a high-performance, in-memory database engine optimized for SQL querying on local machines. We have set things up for participants to use DuckDB at no cost and with minimal friction. This is not just a tool, but an exciting opportunity to learn a new, efficient way of querying data for an ML model. This combination of Parquet and DuckDB ensures that participants can quickly and effectively analyze the data, gaining deeper insights into the fiscal dynamics of French municipalities.

By engaging in this challenge, participants will not only showcase their AI and ML skills but also play a crucial role in contributing to the broader goal of making European policies grounded in science. This collaborative effort between data enthusiasts and the JRC aims to generate actionable insights that will significantly aid in the effective governance and fiscal management of French municipalities. Your work, therefore, holds immense value and influence in shaping evidence-based policymaking.
